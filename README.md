# Scroll-on-link-click
A function that smoothly scrolls the page to the anchor attached to the link.


# What for?
When you need to create links on the site that lead to some «anchors», you have to write code (**Oh yes, I discovered America**). Also, for a better User Experience, consider smooth scrolling. Everything is already done in my repository.

# What should be done?
You just need to add the `id` attribute to the anchor, then add the special `data-goto` attribute to the link leading to the anchor. And then the thing is small - add the script to your JavaScript file.

# Honest Confession
**~~I stole this code~~**
